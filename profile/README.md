# WATERFLOW CLOUD

## ðŸ‘‹ Hi there,

This is the Waterflow Cloud Team, which focus on basical equipment for Information Technology and computer architectures.  \
The waterflow Cloud would do our best to provide the online VOD service and other media-stream processors with high quality.

It is an open, distributed, freely built open source project. It has two external service methods: you can build and adjust the services provided by Waterflow on your own private server according to the documentation guidelines, and use the SDK to call the services. Or, if you want to avoid the trouble of building services, you can also use and call the official services we provide.

To read more about our production please refer to
